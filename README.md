#  RNN-LSTM Aggressiveness Text Classifier

This project demonstrates a **text classification model** built using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** with **LSTM** layers to detect **aggressive content in textual data**. It includes detailed data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation â€” all performed in a Jupyter Notebook.
Objective: To classify tweets as aggressive or not, given geographical, temporal and content-based features

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Binary classification: **Aggressive** vs **Non-Aggressive** text
- Preprocessing with tokenization, padding, and label encoding
- Deep learning model using **Embedding + LSTM + Dense layers**
- Trained on a sample dataset
- Final accuracy: **~90%**

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for deep learning
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization
- Scikit-learn for performance metrics

ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- Embedding Layer: Converts words to dense vectors
- LSTM Layer: Captures sequential dependencies
- Dense Output Layer: Binary prediction with Sigmoid activation

ðŸ“Š Evaluation
