# Brain Tumor Classifier 
This project implements a **deep learning model** to classify **brain MRI scans** as either **tumorous** or **non-tumorous** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Built in Python using **TensorFlow/Keras**, this model achieves **up to 97% accuracy** and is ideal for educational and medical research applications.
## Key Features
- Binary classification: **Tumor** vs **No Tumor**
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN architecture trained from scratch
- Achieves up to **97% validation accuracy**
- Confusion matrix and classification report included
- Easily extendable for multiclass classification

##  Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab (recommended for GPU support)
